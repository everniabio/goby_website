          <h3>Alternative routing app for city strolling</h3>
          <p>
            Web mapping services such as Gmaps only suggest the shortest route (in terms of distance and/or time). The goal of this project was to automatically suggest alternative more enjoyable routes, which might take marginally more time but go through spots that would be more interesting to the user. In order to do that, we defined a scoring function that weights each path based on social media data. Afterwards, we proposed two new graph based optimization algorithms and developed a POC.

          <h3>Set list planner for DJs</h3>
          <p>
            Spliff is a venture created to develop new algorithms for music libraries exploration and organization. The goal is to allow DJs to plan DJ sets in a smarter way than current tools available in the market such as RekordBox and MixedInKey. By choosing a set of rules such as harmonic mixing, set length and BPM constraints, Spliff’s AI is able to assist the DJ in planning the set by suggesting customized alternatives at every time step. Ultimately the DJ should be able to plan and visualize several metrics of the Set in a much faster and intelligent way.
